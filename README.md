# 📚 React Redux Library Management

Welcome to my **React Redux Library Management** project!  
This repository showcases my learning and implementation of **Redux**, **React-Redux**, and **middleware logging** concepts — helping manage and track state effectively in a React application.

## 🚀 About the Project

This project simulates a simple **Library Management System** using Redux.  
Users can add books with details such as **Title**, **Author**, and **ISBN**. The app also uses **custom logger middleware** to monitor actions and state changes in the Redux store.
